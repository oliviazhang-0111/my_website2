```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

```

The `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glipmse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Our task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for China. 

We have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below. 

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "China")

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for China. We should use  `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)`  to plot the underlying trendlines.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
 plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
   NULL 

 plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
 plot1<- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   labs(title = "Life Expectancy of China from 1952 to 2007",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
   NULL


 print(plot1)
```


Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in Asia. 

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
 ggplot(data = continent_data, mapping = aes(x =  year, y = lifeExp , colour= country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
 ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends
   NULL
```

> Analysis  

We generally can see an upward trend regarding life expectancy in all continents. However, several African countries suffered from a decrease since 1985, possibly due to unstable political environments and social unrest. There are two obvious outliers, an African country in 1992 and an Asia country in 1976, both of which had a sudden drop in the expected age, which I think can be caused by wars. European and Oceanian had high levels of life expectancy back in 1952, and they continued to live longer thanks to the improvement of technology (I guess).
